# BillApplication
This is a demo app, where I implemented google play billing. 
Also, you can find how to test the app and how to get the response of a successful transaction. 
Here is the documentation of implementing google in-app purchase billing's implementation process. https://println.home.blog/2019/05/04/google-play-in-app-purchase-in-kotlin/
Very soon a documentation for testing the app will be added.
